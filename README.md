# PRODUCT-ANALYSIS _ NESTLE
A product comparison dashboard to help the company decide on its expansion plans.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Nestlé is the largest food company in the world, marketing over 8,500 brands and 30,000 products. It operates nearly 500 factories across 5 continents and employs over 200,000 employees worldwide. As the World Food Company, Nestlé is the provider of the best food for whatever time of day and for whatever time of your life. Nestlé R&D Australia plays an important role in the development of products for Nestlé Nutrition, with a focus on creating products with micronutrient fortification to address deficiencies. 

The company wants to expand its business by adding new product lines. However, the Head of Growth and Strategy suggested that it was important to know the performance of the current products.
